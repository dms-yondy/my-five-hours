# Design Document for My Five Hours App
The five hour rule is an idea that you should spend one hour a day five times a week to deliberate practice or learning. You can read more about the five hour rule [here](https://www.tameday.com/the-power-of-the-five-hour-rule/).

The aim of this app is to help people keep track of what they have spent their five hours on each week. This will help people keep their five hours organized as well as help them with reflecting what they have learned.
