# my-five-hours
An app that helps people track what they are learning if they are following the five hour rule.

The five hour rule says that you should spend one hour every weekday learn something new. The thing you learn can be anything. The point is that you are always trying to learn and improve. The purpose of this app is to help people to reflect and consolidate their learning from the five hour rule.

This app was written using the MERN Stack. Which is MongoDB, Express, React and Node.js.
